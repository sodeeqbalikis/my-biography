        <p>
     At the age of 2, i was enrolled to Jinya nursery & pry school at obalende, lagos island.
     I couldn't finish my school there because we relocate, then i continue my primary school at De-folrem nursery & primaryschool located at bakare faro street, mosafejo, lagos.<br/>
     I considered several schoools when i was applying for college,i choose to begin my education at sunfab college
     located at alafia. At some point i couldn't affpord the tution anymore i opt in to a government school which is 
     Adebola Baptist Senior high school at surulere because of it's flexiblity and cost savings of which i can say it's one
     of the best school in district IV. The year 2023 will make it six years since i graduated from high school.
      <p> 
     To further more, i choose Abubakar tafawa balewa university, Bauchi to complete my bsc which am still on it, i choose north because 
     i wanted the oportunity to a part of larger, more diverse student and experienced.<br/> i majored in business Management, so several
     of my courses directly prepared me for the role of a business manager. Most of my course require extensive research.<br/>
     even when maintaining a dedicated approach to everything we do, there are obstacle that prevent us from reaching our objectives.
     I met an unexpected challenge in my second year at the university. In my first year my grade was 3.95, then i relented. In my second year
     i had a drop down. this made feel so down, then i started adopting a pesssimistic attitude on education. After some self- counselling 
     i thought about how to proceed then i recognized the task and action needed to take.

    <p>
  After finishing my senior secomndary school in 2017, i thought of what to do, then i opt in for teaching, no knowledge is a waste, because while teaching the young ones i learnt 
  alot of things also. Little kids can be so frustrating and also amazing. My experience with them would be cherished forever.<br/>When i first started my teaching career, i made a
  mistake when asking questions. I would ask if they had any questions,and they were quiet so i assumed everythimng was fine. When i gave my first test, i realized students misunderstood 
  some important concepts. I realised i could do more to check for students misunderstanding during my lessons.<br/>I added specific content questions into my lesson plans to review the material 
  On the next test, the average score increased by 10 points. I've learn from that mistake that checks for understanding are an essential part of all lessons, and now i plan them carefully in advance.
  After that while in school, i venture into water bottles and water flasks business which yield lopt of profit for me.
